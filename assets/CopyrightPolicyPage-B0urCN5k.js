## **Repeat Infringers**

It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are determined to be repeat infringers.

A repeat infringer is generally a user who has received multiple valid copyright infringement notices within a certain period, as determined at our discretion. We consider various factors, including the number and nature of notices and any counter-notifications.

We also reserve the right to take action in cases of serious copyright violations or fraudulent activities, even if a user does not strictly meet the repeat infringer threshold.

## **Limitation of Liability**

PixAI shall not be liable for any mistaken removal or failure to remove allegedly infringing content, provided that it acts in good faith in accordance with this policy. Users agree that PixAI is not responsible for resolving copyright disputes and that such disputes should be addressed directly between the copyright holder and the alleged infringer.
